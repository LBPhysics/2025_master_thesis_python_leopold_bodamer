# Template for qspectro2d simulation config
# List every supported parameter with a brief explanation.
# Units:
# - Frequencies in wavenumbers [cm^-1]
# - Times in femtoseconds [fs]
# - Bath parameters (cutoff, temperature, coupling) are in angular-frequency units used by the solver
#
# Notes:
# - Keep array lengths consistent (e.g., one dipole per atom).
# - For dimers, set coupling_cm to the electronic coupling between the two sites.
