# Template for qspectro2d simulation config
# List every supported parameter with a brief explanation.
# Units:
# - Frequencies in wavenumbers [cm^-1]
# - Times in femtoseconds [fs]
# - Bath parameters (cutoff, temperature, coupling) are in angular-frequency units used by the solver
#
# Notes:
# - Keep array lengths consistent (e.g., one dipole per atom).
# - For dimers, set coupling_cm to the electronic coupling between the two sites.

atomic:
  # Number of atoms/sites in the aggregate (>= 1)
  n_atoms: 4
  # Site transition frequencies [cm^-1]; length must equal n_atoms
  frequencies_cm: [16000.0] * 4

  # Transition dipole moments (relative units); one per site
  dip_moments: [1.0] * 4

  # Max excitation manifold to include (1=single-exciton; 2=up to double-exciton)
  max_excitation: 2

config:
  # Solver backend: options include 'ME' (Lindblad/Markovian), 'BR' (Bloch-Redfield),  'Paper_eqs' (which excplicitly use the equations of motion derived in the paper I and II), # TODO extend to'HEOM' (if available)
  solver: ME

  # Signal types to compute; common: ['nonrephasing', 'rephasing']
  signal_types: [rephasing]
