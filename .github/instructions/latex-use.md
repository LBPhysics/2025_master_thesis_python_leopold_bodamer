# LaTeX Usage Guidelines

## Scope
Apply to all LaTeX files in this workspace, including thesis-related notes or exports.

## Consistency
- Use consistent notation for symbols and units.
- Define new macros in a central place, not inline.
- Avoid hard-coded formatting; use semantic commands.

## Figures & Tables
- Keep figures in figures/ with clear names.
- Always add captions and labels; reference with \ref/\autoref.

## Bibliography
- Keep bibliography entries in a single .bib file when applicable.
- Use the citation style defined by the project.

## Build Hygiene
- Do not edit compiled artifacts (.aux, .bbl, .toc, etc.).
- Keep line lengths reasonable to improve diffs and reviews.
